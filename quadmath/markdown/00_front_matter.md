# QuadMath: An Analytical Review of 4D and Quadray Coordinates

## Abstract

We review a unified analytical framework for four dimensional (4D) modeling and Quadray coordinates, synthesizing geometric foundations, optimization on tetrahedral lattices, and information geometry. Building on R. Buckminster Fuller's synergetics [Synergetics (Fuller)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergetics_(Fuller)) and the Quadray coordinate system, with extensive reference to Kirby Urner's computational implementations across multiple programming languages (see the comprehensive [4dsolutions ecosystem](https://github.com/4dsolutions) including Python, Rust, Clojure, and POV-Ray implementations), we review how integer lattice constraints yield integer volume quantization of tetrahedral simplexes, creating discrete "energy levels" that regularize optimization and enable integer-based optimization. We adapt standard methods (e.g., [Nelder–Mead method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder%E2%80%93Mead_method)) to the quadray lattice, define [Fisher information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_information) in Quadray parameter space, and analyze optimization as geodesic motion on an information manifold via the [natural gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gradient). We also integrate 4D namespaces (Quadray, Extended Euclidean, relativistic Einsteinian spaces), develop analytical tools and equations, and survey extensions and applications across AI, [active inference](https://welcome.activeinference.institute/), cognitive security, and complex systems. The result is a cohesive, interpretable approach for robust, geometry-grounded computation in 4D.

Keywords: Quadray coordinates, 4D geometry, tetrahedral lattice, integer volume quantization, information geometry, optimization, synergetics, active inference.

## Manuscript structure

- Introduction: motivates Quadrays, clarifies 4D namespaces (Coxeter.4D, Einstein.4D, Fuller.4D), and summarizes contributions.
- Methods: details coordinate conventions, exact tetravolumes, conversions, and lattice-aware optimization methods (Nelder–Mead and discrete IVM descent).
- Results: empirical comparisons and demonstrations are shown inline and saved under `quadmath/output/` (PNG/CSV/NPZ/MP4) for reproducibility.
